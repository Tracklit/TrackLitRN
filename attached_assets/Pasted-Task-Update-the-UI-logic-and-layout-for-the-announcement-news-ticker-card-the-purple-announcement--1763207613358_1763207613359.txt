Task:
Update the UI logic and layout for the announcement/news ticker card (the purple announcement carousel under the top nav) to support a new hide/unhide experience. When dismissed, the ticker should collapse into a slim tab. Tapping the tab should restore the ticker with smooth animations. The final result must match the app’s dark, rounded, soft-glow visual style.

🔧 Required Changes
1. When user taps the X button on the announcement card:

Implement the following behaviors:

The purple announcement card slides upward 10–14px and fades out (120–180ms).

The entire card container collapses height down to a 6–8px slim bar located exactly where the card was.

This collapsed bar becomes a rounded “Updates” tab with:

dark or slightly translucent background matching the app’s dark gradient

soft border radius (8–12px)

a small chevron icon (▼) indicating expand

text label: “Updates”

The tab should fade in and slide down slightly (3–4px) when appearing.

2. When user taps the collapsed “Updates” tab:

Restore the full announcement card using these animations:

Tab slightly slides upward and fades out.

The container expands downward to the original card height (200–260ms, ease-out).

The purple announcement card slides in from below and fades in.

The carousel indicators and content appear last with a subtle fade (optional).

Chevron rotates from ▼ → ▲ during expansion.

3. Visual and Interaction Requirements

The collapsed tab must always remain visible after dismissing the ticker.

The tab should not interfere with the top navigation icons.

Use the app’s existing rounded-corner style and dark/blurry/glow visual treatment.

Ensure gestures and taps work smoothly on mobile.

Maintain original carousel functionality when expanded.

🎨 Design Intent

The goal is to provide:

a non-intrusive but always-available way to reopen the ticker

smooth, premium-feeling animations

UI consistency with the dark gradient background and rounded cards

clear, intuitive affordances for hide/unhide actions

📦 Output Requirements

Implement the expanded/collapsed states

Write or update the component code, styles, animation logic, and state handling

Maintain compatibility with the current UI theme and components

Final result must be polished, visually consistent, and mobile-friendly

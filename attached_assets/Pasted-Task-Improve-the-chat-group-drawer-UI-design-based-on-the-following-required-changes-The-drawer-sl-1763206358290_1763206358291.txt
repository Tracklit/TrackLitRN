Task:
Improve the chat-group drawer UI design based on the following required changes. The drawer slides in from the right side, and the updated design should reflect a modern, clean, high-contrast dark-mode aesthetic with improved usability.

Make the following changes:
1. Improve Visual Hierarchy

Increase contrast between chat titles and message previews.

Make titles brighter and previews dimmer.

Add subtle separators or card-like containers to distinguish each chat row.

Ensure consistent vertical spacing across all chat items.

2. Enhance Drawer "Slide-Out" Effect

Add a soft shadow or gradient on the left edge to reinforce depth.

Ensure the drawer visually overlaps the main screen slightly.

Optionally add a slim left-side drag handle for intuitive “close” behavior.

3. Make Top Actions More Discoverable

Increase the tap target size of the "+" (new chat) button and the filter dropdown.

Add a label or tooltip for the "+" button (e.g., “New Chat”).

Improve alignment and spacing of filter controls.

4. Improve Profile Image Handling

Replace blank circles with a default avatar graphic.

Improve clarity of presence indicators — use a simple colored dot instead of the small green globe.

5. Improve Legibility in Dark Mode

Increase overall text contrast (lighter text on dark background).

Slightly increase the font size of the message preview for readability.

6. Add Clear Unread Message Indicators

Bold the chat title for unread chats.

Add a notification dot or numeric badge on the right.

Optionally give unread chats a slightly tinted background.

7. Clean Up Date Alignment

Add more padding between chat text and the date on the right.

Reduce the visual weight of the date (smaller, muted text).

8. Support Swipe Actions

Add swipe gestures:

Swipe left → delete or archive

Swipe right → pin or mark as unread

9. Improve Search Behavior

Replace “Pull down to search” with a persistent search bar at the top, or

Enhance the pull-down indicator to be more visible and animated.

10. Add Subtle Animations

Add a soft, eased slide-in animation for the drawer.

Animate chat rows with a slight stagger fade+slide.

Add fade animation for the search bar.

Output Requirements

Update the UI code to apply all changes.

Ensure components remain mobile-friendly and responsive.

Maintain compatibility with the existing design system and theme.

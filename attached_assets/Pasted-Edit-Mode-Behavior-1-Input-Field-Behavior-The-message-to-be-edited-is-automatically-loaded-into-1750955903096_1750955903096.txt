Edit Mode Behavior

1. Input Field Behavior
	•	The message to be edited is automatically loaded into the standard input field at the bottom of the chat screen (the same one used for sending new messages).
	•	The input field is pre-filled with the original message content.
	•	The Send button changes to a “Checkmark” (✓) icon to confirm the edit.
	•	The user can edit the message just like composing a new one.

2. Editing Indicators
	•	A subtle Editing... label or indicator appears near the input field, usually above or below it, to show that the user is editing an existing message—not composing a new one.
	•	The message being edited may briefly highlight or be indicated visually (e.g., slight flash, underline, or border) when edit mode is triggered.

3. Cancelling the Edit
	•	The user can cancel the edit by tapping an X or Cancel button (usually on the left side of the input field).
	•	This clears the input field (or restores it to the previous draft), exits edit mode, and returns the input field to normal compose mode.

4. Sending the Edit
	•	When the user taps the ✓ button:
	•	The updated message is sent to the server.
	•	The original message in the chat bubble is updated visually.
	•	A small (edited) label is displayed next to the message timestamp.
	•	If the user sends the exact same message with no changes, nothing is updated.

🕓 Editing Rules
	•	Messages can typically be edited for up to 48 hours after sending.
	•	Only the sender of the message can edit it.
	•	All message types that support text (1:1 chats, group chats, supergroups) support editing.

⸻

🔄 Message Updates
	•	Once edited, the updated message appears in-place in the chat history.
	•	If multiple clients are logged in (e.g., mobile + desktop), the update is synced in real-time across devices.

🧠 UX Notes for Implementation
	•	Keep message editing fast and responsive — no spinners unless necessary.
	•	Ensure the input field auto-focuses when entering edit mode.
	•	Don’t disrupt the user’s scroll position when editing older messages.

In the group chat interface, the user’s own messages appear aligned to the right, while messages from all other users are aligned to the left. This directional split creates a clear, consistent visual distinction between the sender (you) and other participants, improving readability and orientation within fast-paced group conversations.

🧊 Message Bubbles
	•	User Messages (Right-Aligned)
	•	Displayed in a distinct color (e.g., blue or green)
	•	Speech bubble anchored to the right side
	•	No avatar shown next to user’s own messages
	•	Timestamp shown bottom-right of bubble on hover or tap
	•	Reactions, replies, or read status may appear below or to the left of the bubble
	•	Other Users’ Messages (Left-Aligned)
	•	Displayed in neutral or light-colored bubbles (e.g., white or grey)
	•	Aligned to the left side
	•	Avatar + display name shown above or beside the first message in a message group
	•	Messages from the same user are grouped together to reduce visual noise
	•	Timestamp shown bottom-left or inline on hover

🧵 Replies & Mentions
	•	Inline replies show a quoted preview bubble above the message being sent, respecting alignment (right for user, left for others).
	•	Mentions (@username) are highlighted with subtle background color for visibility.
	•	Users mentioned will receive notification pings, and messages will be scrollable-to on tap.

🎨 Design Considerations
	•	Consistent padding and bubble spacing ensure legibility and avoid clutter.
	•	Speech bubble corners:
	•	Slightly rounded, with sharper top corners and more curved bottoms.
	•	Tail or “pointer” may be present to indicate directionality (optional).
	•	Color accessibility is considered—contrast ratios meet WCAG AA+ standards.
	•	When dark mode is enabled, bubble colors invert accordingly (e.g., navy for self, dark grey for others).

💡 Benefits of This Layout
	•	Mirrors familiar patterns from apps like Telegram, WhatsApp, and iMessage.
	•	Instantly orients the user in the flow of conversation.
	•	Visually separates “sent” and “received” without the need for labels.
	•	Enhances usability, especially in high-volume group chats.
